The Gupta Empire was an ancient Indian empire existing from the mid-to-late 3rd century CE to 543 CE. At its zenith, from approximately 319 to 
467 CE, it covered much of the Indian subcontinent.[4] This period is considered as the Golden Age of India by some historians.[5][note 1] The
ruling dynasty of the empire was founded by the king Sri Gupta; the most notable rulers of the dynasty were Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and
Chandragupta II alias Vikramaditya. The 5th-century CE Sanskrit poet Kalidasa credits the Guptas with having conquered about twenty-one
kingdoms, both in and outside India, including the kingdoms of Parasikas, the Hunas, the Kambojas, tribes located in the west and east Oxus
valleys, the Kinnaras, Kiratas, and others.[7][non-primary source needed]

The high points of this period are the great cultural developments which took place primarily during the reigns of Samudragupta, Chandragupta 
II and Kumaragupta I. Many of the literary sources, such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, were canonised during this period.[8] The Gupta period
produced scholars such as Kalidasa,[9] Aryabhata, Varahamihira, and Vatsyayana who made great advancements in many academic fields.[10][11]
[12] Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era.[11] The period gave rise to achievements in architecture,
sculpture, and painting that "set standards of form and taste [that] determined the whole subsequent course of art, not only in India but far
beyond her borders".[13] Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural centre and established the region as a base that would 
influence nearby kingdoms and regions in South Asia and Southeast Asia.[14][unreliable source?] The Puranas, earlier long poems on a variety 
of subjects, are also thought to have been committed to written texts around this period.[13][3] Brahmins flourished in the Gupta empire but
the Guptas tolerated people of other faiths as well. Vedic sacrifices reduced in the Gupta period[15]
